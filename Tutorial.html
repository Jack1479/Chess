        <u><p>How The pieces move</p></u>
        </div>
    <div class = 'text'>   
    <p><strong>The Pawn♟️:</strong>From the start square you get a choice to move the piece forward 1 or 2 squares. However once you have moved it off the starting position it can only move forward 1 square at a time. The pawn can also only take pieces diagonally infront of them.</p>
    <p><strong>The rook♜:</strong>This piece can only move up, down, left and right and therefore can only capture this way.</p>
    <p><strong>The bishop♝:</strong>There is a black and a white squre bishop, meaning those bishops can only travel on those squares. The bishop can only capture and move diagonally</p>
    <p><strong>The knight♞:</strong>They move in an L shape, jumping over other pieces</p>
    <p><strong>The queen♛:</strong>It can move in all directions so therefore can capture in all directions also </p>
    <p><strong>The king♚:</strong>This is the piece you want to protect from being captured.It can only move 1 square at a time but in all drections, can even capture pieces. </p>
    <p><strong><u>Special Moves</u></strong></p>
    <p><strong>Castling:</strong> This can only be done if there is no pieces inbetween the king and rook, and niether the king or rook has been moved in the game. the king also cant be in check.If you castle king side then it is done by moving your king 2 places to rightand the rook jumps over.if you are doing it queen side the king moves 2 to the left and the rook jumps over. This is castling for white, it would be the opposite if you were black.</p>
    <p><strong>Promotion:</strong> This is when a pawn reaches it to the other end of the board, this allows it to turn into any piece.</p>
    <P><strong>En passant:</strong>This is when the opposition moves there pawn out 2 spaces, putting it directly next to yours. in this case you can move the pawn diagonally in that direction to cature it.</P>
    <P><strong><u>Mode Rules</u></strong></P>
    <p><strong>Normal</strong>The aim of the game is to checkmate the opposition king, this is when the king is in check (threatened to be taken) and there is no legal moves to help the king esacpe.</p>
    <p><strong>Atomic:</strong>In this mode the rules of chess are the same and all the pieces move in the same way but when you capture a piece, any pieces in a 1 square radius get captured</p>
    <p><strong>3-Check:</strong> In this mode the rules are the same and the pieces move in the same way, but once the king i checked 3 times the game is over.</p>
